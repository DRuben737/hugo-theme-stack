### ‚úàÔ∏è Teaching Philosophy

I believe great instruction must go beyond the checkride. I focus on:
- Scenario-based learning  
- Risk-based decision making  
- Human factors and system safety integration

I‚Äôve taught students from diverse backgrounds, including international and multilingual learners, and designed tools and workflows that enhance safety, clarity, and efficiency in the cockpit and classroom.
