### ✅ Overview

As a Certified Flight Instructor (CFII-A/H), I developed a web-based **Endorsement Generator Tool** to simplify and standardize the endorsement process for instructors under **14 CFR Part 61**.

This tool allows instructors to quickly generate FAA-compliant endorsements by selecting the student scenario and applicable regulations, then automatically producing the correct verbiage for logbook entries or digital records.
